# Clean code principle and enemies

## Principles

### Reliability

- a reliable code means it is `correct` , `stable` and `resilient`.
  
#### correct

- the code is considered correct it is able to fulfill the requirements
- [validate email address](./validate-email.test.js)
- testing the code is essential to verify it is correctness

#### stable

- stable code can handle different `valid inputs`, it also means
  your code she be able to handle different environments, operating systems
  and screen sizes.

- the code stability is confirmed also by using set of tests.

#### resilience

- resilience code can handle `unexpected inputs`
- [browser support mp4](./supportMp4.test.js)
- writing resilience code make our software more stable.

### Efficiency

- efficiency factors are `time` and `space`
- [time](./time.test.js)
- [space](./space.test.js)

### Maintainability

### Usability

## Enemies

### JavaScript

### Management

### Self

### the cargo cult
