# What is clean code?

- when you think of a clean code you must always keep the user in mind.
- [validate postal code](./validate-postal-code.js)

- the `first step to write a code` (solve a problem ) is to understand, `what
  is the problem`, are there any existing solution(s), can we improve the
  existing solution(s).

- after understanding the problem clearly, then you can start `planning and writing
  the code`, which will solve this problem.

- one important reason to fail solving a problem is misunderstanding the problem.
